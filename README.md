# snaplet-neo4j

This is a snaplet that integrates neo4j into the Snap framework.  It is
designed for use as a library, so you should add it to you \*.cabal file once
it's ready.  This also adds support for sessions and auth via Neo4j, as well as
a HasNeo4j typeclass that works in the expected manner.
